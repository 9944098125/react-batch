						and Niyama are systematically described by Patanjali in his Sanskrit

					<h4 class="text-white">
						The term Hatha Yoga has been commonly used to describe the practice
						of asana (postures). The syllable 'ha' denotes the pranic (vital)
						force governing the physical body and 'tha' denotes the chitta
						(mental) force thus making Hatha Yoga a catalyst to an awakening of
						the two energies that govern our lives. More correctly the
						techniques described in Hatha Yoga harmonise and purify the body
						systems and focus the mind in preparation for more advanced chakra
						and kundalini practices.

						Jnana Yoga is the process of converting intellectual knowledge into

						nature and the universe. Jnana Yoga is described by tradition as a
						means to obtain the highest meditative state and inner knowledge.
						Jnana literally means 'knowledge', but in the context of yoga it
						means the process of meditative awareness which leads to
						illuminative wisdom.

					<h4 class="text-white">
						It is not a method by which we try to find rational answers to
						eternal questions, rather it is a part of meditation leading to
